<li><p><b> WORKING AS A RETAIL WORKER </b></p></li>
<p> I work as a part-timer during the semester break. It was a great journey where I learned how to serve the customers well and understand how the retails shop operate.
There are two shift which morning and evening shifts. Sometimes I work during morning shifts and the rest will be night shift. 
But on the second last week, me and the other staff need to work fulltime from 10:00 A.M. until 10:00 P.M.
It was tiring but a really great experience. It also teached me new knowledge and I was vey grateful to have this experience and got new friends.

<li><p><b> SHORT VACATION WITH FRIEND </b></p></li>
<p> Both me and my friend, Afiqah went to Kedah and stay there for three days. It was very fun and enjoyable. We wnet to several cafes and restaurant and try their best menu. 
The foods we ordered such pizza, spaghetti, croissants, strawberry cakes were so delicious. We also went to dessert shops to bought desserts and it was really mouthwatering. 
Beside going to the cafe, we also went to the shopping mall to buy some souvenirs for our family. Then, we also went to swimming at the hotel pool and enjoying the beautiful sunsets there. 
I really enjoyed the vacation and the time I spent with my friend. It was very valuable time for us.
